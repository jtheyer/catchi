# Catchi
An angler catch log. Let paper logging, although proven useful, be a thing of the past.<br> 
Some main features of the app include:<br>
 <strong>-- Log a catch </strong><br>
&emsp;-- Save bait information (text and picture)<br>
&emsp;-- Automatically pull/attach weather data (based on zip)<br>
&emsp;-- Ability to log "Near miss". Sometimes they don't want to bite, but that doesn't mean<br>
&emsp;they aren't there and you might want to log that location.<br>
